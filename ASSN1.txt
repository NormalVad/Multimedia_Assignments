Indian caste system started as an ancient Hindu way of dividing labor. But as Dr. Ambedkar mentions that it was not only the division of labor but also of laborers. The ideology of caste, a hierarchy system, is not just defined by the scale of purity-pollution but rather by the political and economic powers that a community holds. For the upliftment of the Dalit status, the government has provided them with reservations in government jobs and institution so that they can fulfil their economic needs, also some seats are reserved in the constituencies, which aims at giving them some political power.
The roots of Dalit oppression go back to the origins of the caste system in the Hindu religion. The Dalits are forced to perform menial tasks like skinning the carcass of cows, cleaning sewers, etc. Due to the recent rise in the economic and political power of the Dalits, the upper caste people are becoming furious, and they resort to violence in an attempt to suppress the Dalits. The upper-caste people, as a result, try to find ways to harass the Dalits, so as to maintain their dominance over them.ab
